2
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:08,420
Hello, and welcome to
The Official Xbox Podcast.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,330
I'm your host, Tina Amini, and
we have a very special episode

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,550
today, as you can
probably tell by the fact

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,560
that, I'm joined by
Phil, Sarah, and Matt.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,670
Welcome.

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,520
And we're going to talk
about some updates at Xbox.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,500
We want to talk about
game exclusivity.

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,210
We want to talk about
Activision Blizzard

10
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,640
now that they're a part of
our portfolio, how that might

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,117
be an impact on Game Pass.

12
00:00:27,117 --> 00:00:28,700
And we want to talk
about hardware too

13
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,340
and how all of this fits
into the strategy at Xbox.

14
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,930
So where should we start, Phil?

15
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,040
Well, when we originally had
planned for this show starting

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,740
back in December,
I think we probably

17
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,230
would have started with
Activision Blizzard,

18
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,840
maybe talked a little
bit about the exclusivity

19
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,000
with some of the news coming
up, and then hardware.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,870
But we've had some unforeseen
news that has come out.

21
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,140
So let's just go and tackle
the exclusivity question,

22
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,450
because I know it's on
the minds a lot of people.

23
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,033
We hear from the
community, and that's

24
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,930
an important input for us.

25
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,150
So we made the
decision that we're

26
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,270
going to take four games
to the other consoles--

27
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,510
just four games, not
a change to our kind

28
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,840
of fundamental
exclusive strategy.

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,470
We're making these decisions
for some specific reasons.

30
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,680
We make every decision, really,
with the long-term health

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,360
of Xbox in mind.

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,840
And long-term health of Xbox
means a growing platform,

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,430
our games performing, building
the best platform for creators,

34
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,590
reaching as many
players as we can.

35
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,520
We're always looking to learn as
a leadership team and to grow.

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,650
And we think this is an
interesting point in time

37
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,410
for us to use what some
of the other platforms

38
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,997
have right now to help
grow our franchises.

39
00:01:42,997 --> 00:01:44,080
So we're going to do that.

40
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,750
TINA AMINI: So
these four titles--

41
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,485
what are they?

42
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:47,700
Can you say?

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,830
I'm not going to
name those games.

44
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,750
The teams that are
building those games

45
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,660
have announced plans that
are not too far away.

46
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,210
As we know, game teams
put a lot of energy

47
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,380
into their announcements
with the partners.

48
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,340
So I don't want to take
anything away from those teams.

49
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,390
So I won't be talking about
the titles specifically.

50
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,410
But I think when they come
out, it'll make sense.

51
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,420
TINA AMINI: Can we say
if either of those titles

52
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,550
are Starfield or Indiana Jones?

53
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,950
They are not Starfield
or Indiana Jones.

54
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,810
TINA AMINI: Well,
what was the criteria

55
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,930
in how the team was thinking
about selecting those four

56
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:22,617
titles?

57
00:02:22,617 --> 00:02:24,450
Let me start a little
bit outside of that,

58
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,610
and then I'll get to the
four specific games that

59
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,030
we're talking about right,
now because the fundamental

60
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,965
decision driver for any
decision that we make,

61
00:02:32,965 --> 00:02:35,340
anything we're going to talk
about today is the long-term

62
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,450
health of Xbox--

63
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,150
that we're running a
growing platform that

64
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,060
is reaching more players,
that our games are having

65
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,170
as much success as possible.

66
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,080
And I do have a
fundamental belief

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,420
that over the next
5 or 10 years,

68
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,870
exclusive games, games
that are exclusive to one

69
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,685
piece of hardware, are going to
be a smaller and smaller part

70
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:55,560
of the game industry.

71
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,060
And that's not
some great insight

72
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,920
because if you look
at the last 10 years

73
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,290
and what the biggest games are
today, it's a natural place--

74
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,610
whether it's one console
in PC, multiple consoles,

75
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,320
mobile, console, and PC--

76
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,810
you see big games landing
on multiple platforms.

77
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,710
And we want to be
a great platform

78
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,160
for creators that are trying
to realize that potential.

79
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,700
But now, back to the specifics
of the question on these four

80
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,110
specific titles.

81
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,450
We looked at games that
are over a year old.

82
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,430
So they've been on Xbox
and PC for a while.

83
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,980
A couple of the games are
community-driven games,

84
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,775
new games, kind of first
iterations of a franchise that

85
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:37,650
have reached their full
potential, let's say,

86
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,940
on Xbox and PC--

87
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,910
there's always growth,
franchises that we obviously

88
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,820
want to continue to invest in.

89
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,310
Part of having the ability
to continue to invest

90
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,642
is that the businesses behind
those franchises continue.

91
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:53,100
We think it's important that
these service-based games that

92
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,740
have communities behind them,
that they can have confidence

93
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,490
that they're going to
exist in the future.

94
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,240
So two of them kind of
community-driven games

95
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,800
that will end up
on other platforms

96
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,930
and give us the ability to
continue to invest in them.

97
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,513
We think that's great
for the business

98
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:08,970
and great for the communities--
more players to play with.

99
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,900
Two of the other games are
smaller games that were never

100
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,050
really meant to be built as
kind of platform exclusives

101
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,390
and all the fanfare
that goes around that,

102
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,850
but games that our teams
really wanted to go

103
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,580
build that we love
supporting creative endeavors

104
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,640
across our studios
regardless of size.

105
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,940
And as they've realized their
full potential on Xbox and PC,

106
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,210
we see an opportunity to
utilize the other platforms

107
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,140
as a place to just drive
more business value out

108
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,260
of those games,
allowing us to invest

109
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,440
in maybe future
iterations of those,

110
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,820
so sequals to those,
or just other games

111
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,740
like that in our portfolio.

112
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,280
And when we don't damage Xbox
and we can grow our business

113
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,310
using what other platforms
have to help us with that,

114
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,300
we're going to do that.

115
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,560
And that's really the story
behind these four games.

116
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,330
And last thing I'll
say looking forward,

117
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,520
I think there is an interesting
story for us of introducing

118
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,200
Xbox franchises to
players on other platforms

119
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,900
to get them more
interested in Xbox.

120
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,600
We think there's a good
brand value for Xbox there.

121
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,158
So four games, no
promise beyond that.

122
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:20,700
So if you're on
those other platforms

123
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,492
and you see these four
games coming, please

124
00:05:22,492 --> 00:05:25,030
don't take it as some signal
that everything's coming.

125
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,190
It's not.

126
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,232
And we're going to learn.

127
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:28,732
TINA AMINI: So when
you are thinking

128
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:31,090
about the future and this
concept of live service games,

129
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,120
games that can benefit
from bigger audiences,

130
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,910
new audiences, how does
that apply to future titles

131
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,770
and how you're applying
that criteria there?

132
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,270
Yeah.

133
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,110
There's really no
fundamental change

134
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,958
to how we think
about exclusivity.

135
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,500
We just came out of
Developer Direct,

136
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,590
which was an awesome show where
we showed great games that

137
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,140
are coming to Xbox,
and PC, and cloud,

138
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,140
which really makes them
accessible to hundreds

139
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,380
of millions of people.

140
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,240
So we're really focused on a
couple platforms and what's

141
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,740
going to show up there.

142
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,707
But our key of
play the games you

143
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:03,790
want, with the people you
want, anywhere you want,

144
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,370
when everybody
plays, we all win--

145
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,710
these have been part of
our strategy for years

146
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,180
and will continue to be.

147
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,460
Our focus is on,
how do we continue

148
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,220
to grow the games industry by
reaching more players in more

149
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,030
places?

150
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,940
And how do we grow
Xbox as part of that--

151
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,280
Xbox as a hardware
platform, Xbox

152
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,470
as a publisher of
great games, and Xbox

153
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,253
as a platform for the
world's best creators.

154
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,670
And then knowing
that, how do we

155
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,265
think about our first
party games and Game Pass?

156
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,000
MATT BOOTY: Yeah.

157
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,538
Well, to build on what Phil just
said, one thing I would add--

158
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:35,830
you were talking about growth--

159
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,000
is just that we've seen this
inversion over the last five

160
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,150
years where it used to be that
the platform was the biggest

161
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,410
thing, and the games would
tuck in within the platform.

162
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,260
Today, big games like
a Roblox or a Fortnite

163
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,810
could actually be bigger
than any one platform.

164
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,420
And that really has changed the
way that we think about things.

165
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,260
So in the midst of all that,
I think we at First Party

166
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,900
can come back to some
core principles--

167
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,110
first, that all of our games
will be on the Xbox platform.

168
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,570
Second, all of our games will
go into Game Pass on day one.

169
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,560
And third, we know that
Game Pass will only

170
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,300
be available on Xbox.

171
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,270
So there's starting
points for us.

172
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,730
As Phil mentioned,
there are games today

173
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,700
that you can play that
only can be found on Xbox.

174
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,480
And at the same time, we want
to bring more of our games

175
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,260
to more players.

176
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,280
So we're going to
continue to look at that.

177
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,587
Kind of moving aside,
though, from some of those

178
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:33,420
and thinking more about,
what does it really

179
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,380
mean for the player?

180
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,930
To me, the two key things are
cross-play and cross-save.

181
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,550
Those things allow us to deliver
on the promise of Xbox, which

182
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,710
is play with your
friends where they are,

183
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,450
play on the devices you want,
play the games you want.

184
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,650
So that is really only
possible at a practical level

185
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,380
when you know that your
saves and your player

186
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,260
are going to be able to
move across all those parts.

187
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,647
So not all of our games
today are necessarily

188
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,980
built to take advantage of that.

189
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,380
There still will be
some games that don't.

190
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,410
As we bring more teams
into the Xbox family,

191
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,510
there's some catchup
to do as we get there.

192
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,480
But that cross-play,
cross-save is 

193
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,350
so fundamental to
what we're doing.

194
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,100
And I think it's something
that we as First Party

195
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,310
get such a good benefit from
being so close to the platform.

196
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,640
Yeah, absolutely.

197
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,750
That's one of the things, like
you said, all of our games

198
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,250
are always in Game Pass.

199
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,235
And so I'm excited to
announce, with the coming

200
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:31,360
together that we had with
Activision Blizzard King,

201
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,919
that Activision
and Blizzard games

202
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,590
are coming to Game Pass
starting with Diablo IV

203
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,850
on March 28, which I'm super,
super excited to share today.

204
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,950
And it's all part
of our commitment

205
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,490
to make Xbox, the Xbox
experience, and the games

206
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,260
that we build as widely
available as possible.

207
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,470
So now the 34 million
Game Pass members

208
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,637
can all enjoy the fantastic
experience of Diablo IV.

209
00:08:53,637 --> 00:08:54,470
TINA AMINI: Amazing.

210
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,600
Can we come back to the point--

211
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,225
Phil, you mentioned
at the top of this,

212
00:08:57,225 --> 00:08:59,950
this isn't really a
change in strategy for us.

213
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,870
Can you recap for
me how it isn't?

214
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,620
Yeah.

215
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,840
And I thought both
Matt and Sarah

216
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,180
did a really nice job of
talking about what we're doing

217
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,900
on Xbox, where we're going.

218
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,710
If you take a platform feature
like Xbox Play Anywhere, which

219
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,657
has been a promise that we've
made on our first party games,

220
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,240
that you can buy our
game once, you're

221
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,820
going to get to play
across Xbox and Windows--

222
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,250
I think we're the only
platform that does this--

223
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,160
that makes it possible
for you not only to play

224
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,850
with your friends
wherever they are,

225
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,300
but to know that you actually
have multiple entitlements

226
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,050
to the games.

227
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,510
I think that's a
technology I'd love to see

228
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,280
applied to more platforms.

229
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,790
But it is this view
that people are

230
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,898
going to play Xbox
in multiple places,

231
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:45,440
whether it's play the games you
want with the people you want

232
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,220
anywhere you want,
whether it's content,

233
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,560
community, and cloud, whether
it's when everybody plays,

234
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,340
we all win--

235
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,310
we've had different
taglines different strategy

236
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,070
kind of words that
we've used, but always

237
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,720
with this view that Xbox
is a platform for creators

238
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,150
who want to reach
the most players.

239
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,220
Our investments in
xCloud, our investments

240
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,860
in franchises like Minecraft,
and now Call of Duty,

241
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,540
and other large
franchises so that we

242
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,500
learn how to build those.

243
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,010
This has been a strategy that
we've been on for, I'd say,

244
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,190
a decade.

245
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,050
It's not about one device.

246
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,250
It's not about games
in service of a device,

247
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,090
but, rather, the devices
that people want to play on

248
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,000
should be in service of making
the games as big and popular

249
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,500
as they possibly could be.

250
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,810
Because, really, a
healthy creator community

251
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,450
on Xbox, a healthy creator
community in gaming

252
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,690
all up is the thing that
all of us as Game Players

253
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,580
should be voting
for, because that's

254
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,860
the thing that will lead to
the best long-term success

255
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,240
and growth in this industry.

256
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,782
TINA AMINI: And my
understanding just

257
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:46,480
from listening, and
learning from you

258
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,520
three over the past
few weeks, just

259
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,680
understanding what's
happening with Xbox

260
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,320
is that we see trends
with player behavior

261
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,960
where people are playing
on multiple devices.

262
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,250
That is the reality.

263
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,570
And we have put some games out
on multiple platforms before.

264
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,265
So my understanding is that
that's been good for players.

265
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:05,890
How does that come
back to the business

266
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,540
with all of that in mind?

267
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,170
Yeah.

268
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,020
As you said, we have shipped
games on other platforms.

269
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,510
In fact, realistically,
if you look

270
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,140
with the addition of Activision
Blizzard and ZeniMax,

271
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,230
we're one of the largest game
publishers on PlayStation.

272
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,810
We're one of the largest
publishers on the Nintendo

273
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,680
Switch, especially when you
put Minecraft into the equation

274
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,180
as well.

275
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,480
And now, we're one of
the largest publishers

276
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,380
on mobile platforms as well.

277
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,970
And that's not something that
we want to back away from.

278
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,850
We want to continue to
be building great games

279
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,400
that millions and millions
of people can love

280
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,410
and that they can
play those games where

281
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,040
they want to go play.

282
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,430
But we do understand
the business success

283
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,500
that Xbox has to have.

284
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,710
Us as leaders in this
business, the system

285
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,677
today, the system
that all companies

286
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:54,760
that we play video games
from is a world of you've

287
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,650
got to be growing
your business--

288
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,470
growth in our Xbox
business is critical to

289
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,060
the long-term health of Xbox.

290
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,970
Many people know I've been
on Xbox for over 20 years,

291
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,310
and I want to make sure
Xbox is in the best

292
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,140
position for the next 20 years.

293
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,900
That means healthy player
community, healthy creator

294
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,130
community, and healthy business.

295
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,470
So when we look at opportunities
to allow more people to play,

296
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,220
more people to engage,
more people to buy,

297
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,470
more people to
subscribe, it's all about

298
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,270
putting Xbox in
the best position.

299
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,340
And our hardware is a
critical component of that.

300
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,670
The absolute best experience
somebody has on Xbox

301
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,948
is hardware that our team
builds and that people play on.

302
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:32,490
But that's not going
to be everybody.

303
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,907
We fully accepted
that we're going

304
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:36,653
to have Xbox players across
all kinds of devices.

305
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:38,070
So I think a lot
of people think

306
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,870
about 2023 is this
incredible year for gaming.

307
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,120
And in a lot of ways, it was.

308
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,100
There was some really
amazing releases

309
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,390
that I think we all enjoyed.

310
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,020
But what were the signals behind
the scenes that maybe indicated

311
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,450
how we wanted to look
at the future of Xbox

312
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,410
and how we keep up
with the industry?

313
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,970
Yeah, such a good question.

314
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,200
And I think as people who
care about the industry, which

315
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,180
I assume is people
who are watching this,

316
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,222
it was an amazing year--
some great launches.

317
00:13:02,222 --> 00:13:03,930
Some of the games that
I think will stand

318
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,370
the test of time and
people will be talking

319
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,720
about a decade from now.

320
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,560
But it's an industry
that didn't really grow.

321
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,580
And what happens when an
industry doesn't grow?

322
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,453
You end up with some job
eliminations, which we had.

323
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:17,870
We had even our
own hard decisions

324
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,640
to make about
building a sustainable

325
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,750
business for ourselves, but in
no way were we alone in that.

326
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,700
When you think about
a healthy industry,

327
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,770
I want players who
believe that they

328
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,350
will find the best games on
the platforms that they love.

329
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,220
I want people who invest
their careers in working here

330
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,590
to feel like this is a place
that they can be successful.

331
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,560
And that really is
down to being part

332
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,450
of an industry that is growing.

333
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,060
If you listen to
Lisa Su, the AMD CEO,

334
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,400
she'll say that
AMD-powered consoles

335
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,250
are likely to decline in 2024.

336
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,760
I think there's an amazing
set of games coming in 2024,

337
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,270
but if we don't get to
growing as an industry,

338
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,830
the industry will struggle.

339
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,570
And today, there's
really two choices

340
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,130
on how do you grow the industry.

341
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,110
Do you say, I have a
fixed number of players,

342
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,810
the players that we have
today, and do I find new ways

343
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,720
to monetize those players to
get more money from the players

344
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,740
that I have?

345
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,170
Or do you think
about, how do I expand

346
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,230
the business I have
by finding new players

347
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,890
and adding those to the base
of players that already play?

348
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,620
Our focus on Xbox
for the last decade

349
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,510
has really been on
that latter point

350
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,940
of, how do we make
sure Xbox is growing?

351
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,670
Growing for our players,
growing for our creators

352
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,950
so those people
are finding success

353
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,130
on our platform, which
will grow the Xbox business

354
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,250
and put Xbox in a position
to be very strong for years

355
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,162
and decades to come.

356
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:39,620
TINA AMINI: Matt,
earlier, you were

357
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,680
talking about these growing
gaming communities, how they're

358
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,690
incredibly large and comparable
on such a different level

359
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,268
when we think about console
audiences-- like you mentioned

360
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:51,560
Roblox, you mentioned Fortnite.

361
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,740
So we're obviously thinking
about our responsibility,

362
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,980
our hardware responsibility in
supporting the growth of gaming

363
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,700
communities.

364
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,800
How has that actually
shown up for the players?

365
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,350
Are there other games we can
speak to from our portfolio?

366
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,140
Well, as Phil mentioned, two
of the biggest ones for us,

367
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,433
Call of Duty and Minecraft--
they are driven just from

368
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:11,850
the bottom-up by the communities
of people that play those

369
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,830
games, which is so great.

370
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,190
Think about it, for
the player community,

371
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,212
it comes down to,
where are the friends?

372
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:20,670
Where are the people
you play with?

373
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,480
And then equally important
is, where have you built up

374
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,890
your library of games, right?

375
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,383
Where have you invested?

376
00:15:27,383 --> 00:15:28,300
Where is that library?

377
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,690
I think those two
things probably

378
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,640
are some of the biggest
influences on where

379
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,250
people choose to play and what
devices they choose to play.

380
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:35,792
Absolutely.

381
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:39,300
When we think about on the
other side, the developer side,

382
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,910
just any game developer
wants their game

383
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,770
to find the biggest
audience possible.

384
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,050
That's just the nature
of building a game.

385
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,300
You want people to
enjoy and participate

386
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,290
in what you've made.

387
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,460
And I think we're in a unique
position to deliver on that

388
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,490
just because we are the
platform-- we build hardware.

389
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,290
We've got a first
party games group.

390
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,140
And then we've got a system
that ties that together that

391
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,750
brings together your
friends, your progression,

392
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,440
your achievements, all of that.

393
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,050
And I think that's
really what has

394
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,850
contributed to the
momentum behind some

395
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,780
of these communities.

396
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,988
SARAH BOND: Yeah, absolutely.

397
00:16:10,988 --> 00:16:13,170
When you just step
back and you look

398
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,300
at the history of
the industry, we've

399
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,080
moved from a place where it
used to be that someone built

400
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,390
and launched a game to
accelerate hardware,

401
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,090
to actually the things
we do with our hardware

402
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,580
and with our platform
are all in service

403
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,560
of making those games bigger.

404
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,140
And we think about that
across all of the investments

405
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,443
we make-- the consoles
we build, the investments

406
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:34,860
we do with things
like cross-play,

407
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,800
cross-progression, the things
that we're doing with cloud.

408
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,950
How do we actually give more
options to game creators

409
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,880
so they can have the
greatest success?

410
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,720
I think one of the fun
recent examples about this

411
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,460
is actually Palworld.

412
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,900
Palworld was able to launch.

413
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,310
They were a game preview.

414
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,690
They launched in Game Pass.

415
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,180
They also simultaneously
launched in Steam.

416
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,150
And so the combination of
those things, Pocket Pair

417
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,670
was able to have this
outsized success.

418
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,360
And it was the largest third
party Game Pass launch ever.

419
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,310
And that's all because
we give creators

420
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,292
options on how they
can launch their games.

421
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,250
We've got subscription.

422
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:08,970
We've got retail.

423
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:09,928
We've got free to play.

424
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,069
We've got game preview.

425
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,150
We have the consoles.

426
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,770
We have our experience on PC.

427
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,450
And they can access
all of those things.

428
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,420
And when we step
back and we just

429
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,060
look at the performance
of our platform all up,

430
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,470
we know it's working.

431
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,630
We're at the highest
level of users on console,

432
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,280
the highest level
of users on PC,

433
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,070
the highest level of
users on cloud ever.

434
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,650
We have double-digit growth
rate on PC and cloud,

435
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,450
places where we're
enabling creators

436
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,140
to actually reach new players
beyond the console ecosystem.

437
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,820
And that's why we're
leaning into it

438
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,285
and doing more, because
we see all those signals.

439
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:42,660
So we're talking
about the role

440
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,103
that hardware plays for
creators, for the games,

441
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:46,020
and those communities.

442
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,460
What about the
role that hardware

443
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,560
plays for us as a
business, for Xbox?

444
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,530
When we look at our
hardware, it really is,

445
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,690
and Phil said this
earlier, it's where

446
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,070
you get the most flagship,
seminal experience of Xbox.

447
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,800
And it also represents
a developer target.

448
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,440
Our developers can build
the specs of our hardware,

449
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,770
and we invest to make sure
when they do that the games are

450
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,560
going to run great
on our hardware,

451
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,110
but they're also going
to be able to be accessed

452
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:16,410
across any screen because of all
the other investments we make.

453
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,830
So we're giving them
an easy way to access

454
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,670
as many players as possible.

455
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,600
And we actually have more
creators right now building

456
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,990
for Xbox than ever
before, thousands of them,

457
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,610
by nature of those investments.

458
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,850
And we got more to come.

459
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,055
There's some exciting stuff
coming out in hardware

460
00:18:32,055 --> 00:18:33,680
that we're going to
share this holiday.

461
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,310
And we're also invested in
the next generation roadmap.

462
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,760
And what we're really focused on
there is delivering the largest

463
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,710
technical leap you
will have ever seen

464
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,980
in a hardware generation, which
makes it better for players

465
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,590
and better for creators and the
visions that they're building.

466
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,030
TINA AMINI: And then when we're
talking about hardware, too,

467
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,440
there's these other
considerations

468
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,232
that are really important
to our community,

469
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,370
probably to each one
of ourselves as well.

470
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,500
When you talk about
library, because I

471
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,390
want to dig in on that
a little bit more--

472
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,660
as we talk about cloud and the
wider entertainment industry,

473
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,370
there's conversations
about streaming.

474
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,400
How is that impacting
how I own my content

475
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,450
that I've invested in?

476
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,920
So what can we say
about our stance

477
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,450
around game preservation?

478
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,350
Yeah.

479
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,530
One of the highlights for
me of being in this position

480
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,810
was getting to stand on
stage when we announced back

481
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,210
compat coming to Xbox One.

482
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,050
It was fantastic.

483
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,550
People were reading
the teleprompter

484
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,680
before I could read,
I'm a slow reader,

485
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,940
and just feeling the
energy in the auditorium

486
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,530
as we were saying
that, and online.

487
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,920
One of the cues, I think, us
as being part of Microsoft

488
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,870
take is looking at Windows,
and how Windows, over decades,

489
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:44,190
has maintained software
compatibility with things

490
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,210
that are built on it.

491
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,640
Like, I can still go back
and play some of the games

492
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,160
that I love playing on
Windows from decades ago

493
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,240
and it will still run.

494
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,720
And we try to bring that
same view to consoles.

495
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,120
It's harder in console
because the line

496
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,940
between what the hardware is
and what the game is in consoles

497
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,340
is traditionally
tighter, which you end up

498
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,260
doing these generational
compatibilities

499
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,800
that we've built. But I will
say compatibility, the ability

500
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,890
to not only play the games,
but my saves are still there

501
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,400
with our cloud save systems,
to try to keep the services up

502
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,620
as long as we can so
that people can play

503
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,960
is a tenet of what
we are as Xbox.

504
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,040
It's at our foundation.

505
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,560
And when we look at future
hardware generations

506
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,380
and what we're going
to support, making sure

507
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,080
that we respect, which is
the word I use "respect"

508
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,380
the investments that people
have made in Xbox going forward

509
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,257
is fundamental.

510
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:36,840
And the fact that
you get entitlements

511
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,420
when you buy a game from
us on both Windows and Xbox

512
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,340
also means you have
the ability to play

513
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,670
that game across a multitude
of devices, which I think

514
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,430
furthers the compatibility
of the games that you own.

515
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,280
Can we go back to what
Xbox stands for today?

516
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,690
I think we've pretty much
covered all of the elements.

517
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,360
But if you could
break it down for me.

518
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,350
When you play on Xbox,
what we're saying is

519
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,120
you're playing on
a platform where

520
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,580
you know the biggest
games in the world

521
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,320
are always going to be.

522
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,090
You're playing on
a platform where

523
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,830
you get to access Game Pass.

524
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,220
And all of the games from our
incredible range of studios

525
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,430
will always launch
in Game Pass day one.

526
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,880
And you're playing on a platform
that's dedicated to you--

527
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,630
player-first features--
cross-play, cross-save,

528
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,740
cross-progression,
backwards compatibility,

529
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,482
being able to play your games
in your library anywhere

530
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:29,940
you want because
of the investments

531
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,290
that we make in cloud gaming.

532
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,540
And so you're playing somewhere
where you're investing

533
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,700
and you know you get to
take the games forward

534
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,530
with you and across all of
the screens where you are.

535
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,135
And I think most importantly,
Xbox is a place where you know

536
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,160
when you're investing
in Xbox, you're

537
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,820
investing somewhere that is
dedicated to making games more

538
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,740
successful and creators
more successful,

539
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,580
so that they can invest more to
bring even better experiences

540
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,440
to you all of the time.

541
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,490
Yeah.

542
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,950
That investment in
the studios is so--

543
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,650
and we feel that as part of
first party with the platform

544
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,680
proximity-- it's
kind of amazing now

545
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,470
to look out across all
the studios that we've got

546
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,660
and just be reminded
that we're now

547
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,000
one of the biggest development
organizations in the industry.

548
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,760
What does that mean for players?

549
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,770
It means that the
biggest games are going

550
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,750
to continue to come to Xbox.

551
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,960
And this 2024, the
year coming up,

552
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,380
we've got more than 10
major releases coming up--

553
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,100
great stuff.

554
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,280
Hellblade 2, they've
got Diablo expansion,

555
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,730
they've got Avowed, Ara,
the Indiana Jones game,

556
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,427
and there's more in
development, which

557
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:38,010
I think we're going to be able
to share more about at our June

558
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,690
showcase coming up pretty soon.

559
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,200
Well, I guess I should get
ready to work on that show.

560
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,890
[LAUGHTER]

561
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,830
Well, thank you all for showing
up on the podcast today.

562
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,940
And we'll see the rest
of you, this June.

563
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,440
Yeah.

564
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,130
Thanks, Tina.

565
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,920
Thank you.

566
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,000
